- Ways of Contributing:
  - You can contribute whatever kind of thing you want. For example:
    - Code (fixing bugs, optimizing code or adding new features)
    - Storyline
- Contributing art (music, textures, sound effects etc. )
  - Contributing Art is great, but ...
  - ...you need to have the rights to the art your contributing.
  - ...you need to know that by contributing art you keep the rights to the art, but allow This Project to use the art.
