## Contributing

    - Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project.
    - Do not make suspicious Pull Requests (for example: Pull Requests which: contain Malware or requires untrusted code)
    - Ways of Contributing:
        - You can contribute whatever kind of thing you want. For example:
            - Code (fixing bugs, optimizing code or adding new features)
            - Storyline
    - Contributing art (music, textures, sound effects etc. )
        - Contributing Art is great, but ...
        - ...you need to have the rights to the art your contributing.
        - ...you need to know that by contributing art you keep the rights to the art, but allow This Project to use the art.
        - ...if you ever decide you want your art to get removed from this project, you need to create a Issue or Pull-Request. Processing those Issues can take a while.
